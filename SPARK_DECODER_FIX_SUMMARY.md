# SparK Decoder Skip Connection Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Coordinate Map Key Mismatch ✅
**Problem:** Decoder skip connections were trying to concatenate sparse tensors with different coordinate map keys (resolutions).

**Root Cause:**
- Encoder stages produce features at resolutions [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [8,8,8], [8,8,8]
- Decoder was using wrong indexing: `skip_idx = len(encoder_features) - 1 - stage_idx`
- This connected decoder stages to wrong encoder stages with mismatched resolutions

**Fix:**
```python
# New formula
skip_idx = num_stages - stage_idx - 3

# Correct mapping:
# Decoder Stage 0 (after upsample to [4,4,4]) → Encoder Stage 1 [4,4,4] ✅
# Decoder Stage 1 (after upsample to [2,2,2]) → Encoder Stage 0 [2,2,2] ✅
# Decoder Stage 2/3 → No skip connection (skip_idx < 0)
```

**Location:** `source/modules/phase0/models/spark_encoder.py:213`

### 2. Channel Allocation Mismatch ✅
**Problem:** After fixing coordinate maps, decoder conv layers received wrong number of input channels.

**Root Cause:**
```python
# OLD (incorrect)
conv_in_channels = upsampled_channels + current_channels  # Used decoder channels
```

The decoder was allocating channels based on its own `current_channels`, but skip connections bring encoder channels which are different.

**Fix:**
```python
# NEW (correct) - Pre-calculate encoder stage channels
encoder_stage_channels = []
enc_channels = base_channels
for i in range(num_stages):
    enc_channels = enc_channels * 2
    encoder_stage_channels.append(enc_channels)
# encoder_stage_channels = [192, 384, 768, 1536] for base=96

# Calculate skip connection channels from encoder
skip_idx = num_stages - stage_idx - 3
if use_skip_connections and skip_idx >= 0 and skip_idx < len(encoder_stage_channels):
    skip_channels = encoder_stage_channels[skip_idx]
else:
    skip_channels = 0

conv_in_channels = upsampled_channels + skip_channels
```

**Example (Decoder Stage 0):**
- Input: 1536 channels
- After upsample: 768 channels
- Skip from Encoder Stage 1: 384 channels
- After concat: 1152 channels (768 + 384)
- Conv receives: 1152 channels ✅

## Test Results

### Debug Output
```
Encoder stages and resolutions:
Stage 0: [2,2,2] (192 channels)
Stage 1: [4,4,4] (384 channels)
Stage 2: [8,8,8] (768 channels)
Stage 3: [8,8,8] (1536 channels)

Decoder stages with skip connections:
Stage 0: upsample [8,8,8]→[4,4,4] (768ch) + skip [4,4,4] (384ch) = 1152ch ✅
Stage 1: upsample [4,4,4]→[2,2,2] (384ch) + skip [2,2,2] (192ch) = 576ch ✅
Stage 2: upsample [2,2,2]→[1,1,1] (192ch) + no skip = 192ch ✅
Stage 3: no upsample [1,1,1] (96ch) + no skip = 96ch ✅

✅ Decoder forward pass successful!

## Architecture Details

### Encoder (SparK)
```
Input: [B, 768, 8, 8, 8] dense features from WaveFormer
↓
Stage 0: Conv stride=2 → [192ch, resolution 2]
Stage 1: Conv stride=2 → [384ch, resolution 4]
Stage 2: Conv stride=2 → [768ch, resolution 8]
Stage 3: Conv stride=1 → [1536ch, resolution 8]  # No downsampling
↓
Output: [1536ch, resolution 8] sparse tensor
```

### Decoder (SparK)
```
Input: [1536ch, resolution 8] sparse tensor
↓
Stage 0: Upsample stride=2 → [768ch, res 4] + Skip[384ch, res 4] → Conv[1152ch→768ch]
Stage 1: Upsample stride=2 → [384ch, res 2] + Skip[192ch, res 2] → Conv[576ch→384ch]
Stage 2: Upsample stride=2 → [192ch, res 1] + No skip → Conv[192ch→192ch]
Stage 3: Upsample stride=1 → [96ch, res 1] + No skip → Conv[96ch→96ch]
↓
Output proj: [96ch] → [768ch] (matches WaveFormer dimension)
```

## Key Insights

1. **MinkowskiEngine Resolution Semantics**: Coordinate map keys represent stride/scale, not spatial dimensions
   - [2,2,2] = stride 2 (coarser)
   - [8,8,8] = stride 8 (coarsest)
   - Upsampling reduces the coordinate map key values

2. **Skip Connection Indexing**: Must account for encoder's last stage having stride=1 (no downsampling), so decoder needs to skip it

3. **Channel Calculation**: Skip connection channels must be pre-calculated from encoder architecture, not inferred from decoder current_channels

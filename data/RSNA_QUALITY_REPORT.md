## âœ… Quality Validation Results

### 1. Format Consistency
- âœ… **Spacing**: 100% of analyzed samples have correct 1.0Ã—1.0Ã—1.0mm isotropic spacing.
- âœ… **Orientation**: RAS standard orientation applied.
- âœ… **Data Type**: Float32 precision across all files.
- âœ… **Channels**: Correct format for each modality (3 for CTA, 1 for MRI/MRA).
- âœ… **File Format**: NIfTI (.nii.gz) with compression.

### 2. Normalization Quality
- âœ… **NyÃºl Normalization**: 98.2% success rate on MRIs (2499 / 2544 files).
- âœ… **Multi-Window Normalization**: Applied to 100% of CTAs (1852 files).
- âœ… **Fallback Normalization**: Percentile normalization used for 45 MRI files where NyÃºl failed.
- âœ… **Value Ranges**: Appropriate for the normalization method used.

### 3. Data Integrity

### Comparison with Other Datasets

| Dataset | Format | Spacing | Data Type | Channels | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **RSNA 2025** | Multi-modal | 1.0Ã—1.0Ã—1.0mm | Float32 | 1/3 | âœ… |
| **OpenMind** | Single-channel MRI | 1.0Ã—1.0Ã—1.0mm | Float32 | 1 | âœ… |
| **DeepLesion** | 3-channel CT | 1.0Ã—1.0Ã—1.0mm | Float32 | 3 | âœ… |

**Result**: âœ… **EXCELLENT** - All three datasets follow identical preprocessing standards and are ready for unified training.

## ðŸš€ Training Pipeline Integration

### Preprocessing Standards Compliance
- âœ… **Spacing**: Unified 1.0Ã—1.0Ã—1.0mm isotropic across all datasets.
- âœ… **Orientation**: RAS standard for spatial consistency.
- âœ… **Data Type**: Float32 for training efficiency.
- âœ… **Normalization**: Appropriate method per modality (Multi-Window for CT, NyÃºl/Percentile for MR).
- âœ… **Format**: NIfTI with preserved metadata.

### Data Loading Strategy
As per the project blueprint (`gemini.md`), the data is prepared for a unified data loader that can handle the multi-modal nature of the combined dataset:
1.  **Modality Detection**: The 1-channel (MRI/MRA) vs. 3-channel (CTA) format allows for automatic modality detection.
2.  **Dynamic Batching**: The loader must handle mixed batches containing both 1-channel and 3-channel images.
3.  **Vessel Masks**: The 180 processed vessel masks are ready to be used as a secondary input channel for the candidate classification model.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- âœ… **PROCEED** with using the processed RSNA, OpenMind, and DeepLesion datasets for unified model training.
- âœ… **EXCLUDE** the 9 failed/unprocessed series from the training set.
- âœ… **IMPLEMENT** a unified data loader capable of handling mixed-channel batches.

### 2. Training Strategy (from `gemini.md`)
- **Phase 0 (Pre-training)**: Use the OpenMind (MRI) and DeepLesion (CT) datasets to pre-train the WaveFormer backbone for a foundational understanding of neurovascular anatomy.
- **Phase 1 & 2 (Training/Fine-tuning)**: Use the full RSNA 2025 dataset for candidate generation and classification, fine-tuning the model on the primary competition data.
